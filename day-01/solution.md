# Day 01 Solution

## Problem
_Describe the problem here._

## Approach

#### Pseudo Code:

Step 01: Create a new function called `compareNumbers`

a. On the first line of input.txt, check for numbers. 
_(We know from the output.txt that they are all 5-digit numbers. But, to make it scalable let's pretend we don't know that info._

b. When the numbers are finished and the type of character is a space, assign a variable to the first number `firstNumber`
console check this worked: console.log eg: _firstNumber = 98076_ 

c. When the spaces are finished, assign a variable for the second number `secondNumber`
console check this worked. console.log eg: "secondNumber = 98765"

d. If there is a space next, do nothing and move to the next character, if there is a line break, console log newline.
